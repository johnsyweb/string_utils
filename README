                               string_utils v0.2
                               =================

Written largely as an exercise, this package contains C++ implementations of
most of the string methods available in Python. 

See the following for an explanation of what these methods should do:

          http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

A better explanation of what these methods actually do is the provided
unit-test code.

UnitTest++ is required to run the unit-tests (`make check`). You can get a copy
here:

                      http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/

To report bugs, please contact Pete Johns (see ./AUTHORS), preferably with a
failing unit-test.
